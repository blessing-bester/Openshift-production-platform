# 🚚 TransGlobe Logistics – Predictive Delivery Optimization

## 📌 The Client  
TransGlobe Logistics is a global freight and delivery company managing thousands of shipments daily across continents. Their mission: move goods faster, cheaper, and more reliably than anyone else.

---

## ⚠️ The Problem  
As operations scaled, TransGlobe is struggling with inefficiencies:  

- **Late Deliveries** → manual route planning can’t adapt to traffic, weather, or port congestion.  
- **High Fuel Costs** → trucks often drive suboptimal routes.  
- **Poor Visibility** → customers have no real-time insights, leading to frustration.  
- **Reactive Monitoring** → problems are discovered only *after* delays occurred.  

This is leading to rising operational costs, unhappy clients, and low revenue.

## 🛠️ The Solution – Init Labs Approach  
We are building a **Predictive Delivery Optimization System** combining **AI, Cloud, and Observability**:

### 🔮 Predictive AI Models
- Machine learning models trained on historical deliveries, traffic data, and weather APIs.  
- Forecasts **delays in real-time** and dynamically reroutes shipments.  

### ☁️ Cloud-Native Infrastructure
- Deployed on **Kubernetes** for scalability and resilience.  
- Automated provisioning with **Terraform + Ansible**.  

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus + Grafana** dashboards track fleet performance, ETAs, and costs.  
- Alerting when delivery predictions breach SLAs.  

### 🌍 Customer-Facing Portal
- **React + FastAPI** app providing live delivery tracking and accurate ETAs.

## ✅ Results  
- **30% fewer delays** from predictive rerouting.  
- **15% cost savings** on fuel and routes.  
- **Happier clients** thanks to accurate, transparent ETAs.  
- A **scalable system** ready for global expansion.
